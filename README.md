# Shell Installer
Hi!
I'm gnohP (OG of Sybau Hub on Shell)
This is a Sybau Hub with the Flatpak package to install all of things like Discord, Chrome, OBS, Spotify and Sober(Roblox for Linux)
this is for fedora only or for some distros has already  installed flatpak so if you use other distro without package may be failed.
Leak for next update:
-"./install-app.sh":
+Add option telegram, brave, tor, vim, edge and steam
+fix bug
-Add "./uninstall.sh"

I don't think so about it, so see you soon!

BITE ME!
